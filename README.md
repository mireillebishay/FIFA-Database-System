# FIFA-Database-System
The project involves three main components: creating an entity-relationship diagram, designing and implementing a database using Microsoft SQL Server, and developing a user-friendly website using ASP.NET and C#.The system's users are divided into five categories: System Admin, Sports Association Manager, Club Representative, Stadium Manager, and Fans. The system also includes entities such as Clubs, Stadiums, Matches, Tickets, and Host Requests. Matches are played by two clubs, with one designated as the host. Club Representatives are responsible for requesting permission to host matches on behalf of their club. The Stadium Manager approves or denies club requests to host matches at their stadium. The System Admin can add, delete, and block fans, as well as manage clubs and stadiums. Sports Association Managers can create, edit, and delete matches. Once a match is approved, tickets become available for purchase and the system keeps track of ticket holders.
